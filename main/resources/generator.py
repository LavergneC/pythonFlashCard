    """
    A generator function that manages a storage system with a given capacity.
    It allows adding or removing quantities from the storage and ensures that
    the storage does not exceed its capacity or go below zero.
    Args:
        storage_capacity (int): The maximum capacity of the storage.
    Yields:
        int: The remaining capacity of the storage after each operation.
    Receives:
        tuple[str, int]: A tuple containing an operation and a quantity.
                         The operation can be '+' to add or '-' to remove
                         the specified quantity.
    Returns:
        str: A message indicating an error, such as an invalid operation,
             storage overflow, or storage < 0.
    Raises:
        StopIteration: When an invalid operation is provided or the storage
                       exceeds its capacity or goes below zero.
